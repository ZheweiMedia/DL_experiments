Connectome-wide Association Studies (CWAS)
------------------------------------------

Introduction & Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Connectome-wide Association Studies (CWAS) allow researchers to explore relationships between patterns of functional connectivity (the functional connectome), behavior, and phenotypic factors.The CWAS method implemented in C-PAC (Shehzad et al., 2014) examines the correlation among patterns of functional connectivity and phenotypes using a combination of Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) and Multivariate Distance Matrix Regression (MDMR; Reiss et al., 2010). Compared to traditional univariate techniques which require rigorous correction for multiple comparisons, a multivariate approach significantly reduces the number of connectivity-phenotype comparisons needed to run a CWAS (Shehzad et al., 2014).

Computation and Analysis Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Computation steps for CWAS are listed below as described by Shehzad and colleagues (2014).

#. For each subject, C-PAC computes the correlation of BOLD signals between every possible pair of gray matter voxels, resulting in a V x V correlation matrix for each subject (where V is the number of gray matter voxels). 

#. To determine individual differences, patterns of whole-brain connectivity for each voxel are compared to the connectivity pattern for the same voxel between all possible pairs of subjects. A distance matrix is then computed which represents the dissimilarity between whole-brain connectivity patterns for any pair of subjects.

#. MDMR is then used to test whether, for each voxel, whole-brain connectivity patterns tend to be more similar for individuals with like phenotypes (within-group) than individuals with unlike phenotypes (between-group). This quantifies how well phenotypic variables explain the distances between participants in the distance matrix. 

#. The significance of these similarities and differences is assessed with a permutation test. This identifies brain regions whose whole-brain pattern of connectivity is significantly predicted by a particular phenotypic variable.

The figure below (taken from Shehzad et al., 2010) outlines these steps. For more detail on how C-PAC handles these computations, please see the `CWAS section of the developer documentation <http://fcp-indi.github.com/docs/developer/workflows/cwas.html>`_.

It is important to note that the results of MDMR analysis do not contain information about the direction of connectivity-phenotype relationships, nor the specific connections underlying these connectome-wide associations. Follow-up analysis using seed-based correlation analysis (or similar methods) is required to discover this information (Shehzad et al., 2014). To avoid bias caused by 'double-dipping' your data (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009), this analysis should always be performed on an independent sample (Shehzad et al., 2014). Further, the results of these follow-up analyses should take into account existing knowledge about brain anatomy and physiology before being considered definitive (Shehzad et al., 2014).

Applications and Recommendations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
As C-PAC is one of the first public software packages to implement CWAS, it has yet to be utilized by more than a few researchers. The most notable use to date is the analysis performed by Shehzad and colleagues, who found robust associations between functional connectivity and a number of phenotypic characteristics including age, ADHD diagnosis, IQ, and *L-dopa* administration.

As CWAS examines connectivity across the whole brain, it may have reduced sensitivity to highly-localized sets of connections related to a phenotype. This issue can be addressed by limiting analysis to connectivity between specific anatomical regions (Shehzad et al., 2014), which can be accomplished by defining an ROI mask during C-PAC setup.

Configuring CWAS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using the GUI
"""""""""""""

.. figure:: /_images/cwas.png

#. **Run CWAS - [Off, On]:** Used to determine if CWAS will be added to the pipeline or not.

#. **CWAS ROI File - [path]:** Path to a mask file. Voxels outside of the mask will be excluded from CWAS.

#. **CWAS Regressor File - [path]:** Path to a text file containing the phenotypic regressor.

#. **CWAS FSamples - [integer]:** Number of permutation tests to run on the Pseudo-F statistics.

#. **CWAS Parallel Nodes - [integer]:** Number of Nipype nodes created while computing CWAS.  Dependent upon computing resources.

#. **Column Number with Regressor of Interest - [integer]:** The index for the regressor of interest.  Indexing starts at 0.

#. **CWAS Regressor Strata - [list]:** A list with length equal to the total number of rows in your regressor file. Each element of the list, indicates that elements group. Leave it as None. if you have a between-subject design and give it a value if not.  For instance, if you have multiple scans per subject, then you would want to do a permutation within-subject between scans. For this to occur, the list below could be something like ['s1', 's1', 's2', 's2', 's3', 's3', ...], indicating what subject each element/scan is associated with and permutations would only be done between scans within each subject.

Configuration Using a YAML File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To configure CWAS options within a YAML file, add the following lines to your file (with appropriate substitutions for paths)::
 
    runCWAS = [0]
    cwasROIFile = '/path/to/cwas_mask_file'
    cwasFSamples = 5000
    cwasParallelNodes = 10
    cwasRegressorFile = '/path/to/cwas_regressor_file'
