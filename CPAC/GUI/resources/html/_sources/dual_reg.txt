Dual Regression
---------------

Background and Information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many large-scale functional brain networks have been shown to be reproducible across subjects (Smith et al, 2009; Yeo et al, 2011). Dual Regression (Beckman et al, 2009; Filippini et al, 2009) allows researchers to investigate individual and group differences in the structure of these networks, as well as to identify subject-specific networks based on networks identified at the group level.

Computation and Analysis Considerations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The following steps are performed for each spatial map provided for Dual Regression:

#. **Spatial Regression:** The spatial map is used as a spatial regressor in a GLM to find the time series associated with the voxels in that map. 

#. **Temporal Regression:** The time series found by spatial regression is then used as a temporal regressor to find the full set of voxels associated with that time series. 

The result of these steps is a subject-specific spatial map based on the original spatial map.

The spatial maps used during Dual Regression can be generated any number of ways, but a common practice is to use Independent Component Analysis (Smith et al, 2009) or clustering algorithms (Yeo et al, 2011) to generate group-specific maps of large-scale brain networks. 

Configuring CPAC to Run Dual Regression
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Spatial maps for use during Dual Regression must be specified on the Spatial Regression page of the CPAC GUI under "Time Series Extraction (TSE)".

.. figure:: /_images/dr_spatial.png

#. **Run Spatial Regression - [Off, On]:** Extract the time series from one or more existing spatial maps (such as an ICA map). Required if you wish to run Dual Regression.

#. **Spatial Map Specification File - [path]:** Full path to a text file containing a list of spatial maps. Each line in this file should be the path to a 4D NIfTI file containing one spatial map per volume.

#. **Demean Spatial Maps - [True, False]:** Demean spatial maps before running spatial regression.

#. **Run Dual Regression - [Off, On]:** Run Dual Regression. Requires that Spatial Regression be enabled under Time Series Extraction

#. **Normalize Time Series - [True, False]:** Normalize time series before running Dual Regression.
