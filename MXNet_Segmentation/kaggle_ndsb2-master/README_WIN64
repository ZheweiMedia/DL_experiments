Here a short list of commands to install required libs on win64..

* MxNet *
Win 8.1 64 bit
nvidia cuda 7.5
anaconda python 2.7 python 64 bit

Download mxnet  windows binary build 20151228 (old build)
Extract to c:\mxnet so that there is a folder cudnn in de folder c:\mxnet

Copy cudnn (v3) into. I can provide these files but they are somehow personally licensed by NVIDIA 
C:\mxnet\nocudnn\3rdparty\cudnn
NOTE!!! I have a cudnn-less dll to get reproducible results..

Run:
C:\mxnet\nocudnn\setupenv.bat

Run cmd (c:)
cd \mxnet\nocudnn\python
python setup.py install

* Dicom and opencv *
pip install pydicom
conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/menpo opencv3
