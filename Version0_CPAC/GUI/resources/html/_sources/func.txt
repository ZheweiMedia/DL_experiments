Functional Preprocessing
-------------------------

Timeseries Options
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: /_images/ts_options.png

#. **First Timepoint - [integer]:** The starting volume of the scan.  If you need to censor the first volumes of a scan to facilitate stable magnetization, you can do so here.

#. **Last Timepoint - [integer/text]:** The last volume of the timeseries.  If you wish to cut off the timeseries before a specific point, you can do so here.  Otherwise, set this to 'End'.

#. **TR - [numerical value]:** The TR for volume acquisitions.  If you wish to have this information read from the NifTI header set this to 'None'.

#. **Perform Slice Time Correction - [On, Off, On/Off]:**  Interpolate voxel timeseries so that sampling occurs at the same time.

#. **Slice Acquisition Pattern - [Use NifTI Header, alt+z, alt+z2, alt-z, alt-z2, seq+z, seq-z]:** The order of slice acquisition for the scans.

Configuration Using a YAML File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To configure the timeseries options within a YAML file, add the following lines to your file (with appropriate substitutions for paths)::

    startIdx : 0
    stopIdx : None
    TR : None
    slice_timing_correction : [0]
    slice_timing_pattern : ['Use NIFTI Header']

Functional to Anatomical Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: /_images/func_to_anat_reg.png

#. **Run Functional-to-Anatomical Registration - [On, Off]:** Register the functional timeseries and functional mean images to the T1 anatomical images.

#. **Using BB Register - [On, Off, On/Off]:** Use Boundary-Based Registration in the functional-to-anatomical registration process. This uses the anatomical segmentation outputs to improve the co-registration of functional images to the anatomical. However, this may not be the best option if your anatomical images feature low contrast, resulting in segmentation which may not be of high quality.

#. **Boundary Based Registration Scheduler - [path]:** Standard FSL 5.0 Scheduler used for Boundary Based Registration. It is not necessary to change this path unless you intend to use non-standard MNI registration.

#. **Use as Functional-to-Anatomical Registration Input - [Mean Functional, Selected Functional Volume]:** Choose whether to use the mean of the functional/EPI as the input to functional-to-anatomical registration or one of the volumes from the functional 4D timeseries that you choose.

#. **Functional Volume to Use as Input (Selected Functional Volume only) - [integer]:** Only for when 'Use as Functional-to-Anatomical Registration Input' is set to 'Selected Functional Volume'. Input the index of which volume from the functional 4D timeseries input file you wish to use as the input for functional-to-anatomical registration.

Configuration Using a YAML File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To configure functional to anatomical registration options within a YAML file, add the following lines to your file (with appropriate substitutions for paths)::

    runRegisterFuncToAnat : [1]
    runBBReg : [1]
    boundaryBasedRegistrationSchedule : /usr/share/fsl/5.0/etc/flirtsch/bbr.sch
    func_reg_input :  ['Mean Functional']
    func_reg_input_volume :  0

Functional to MNI Registration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. figure:: /_images/func_to_mni_reg.png

#. **Run Functional to MNI Registration - [On, Off]:** Register functional images to a standard MNI152 template. This option must be enabled if you wish to calculate any derivatives.

#. **Functional Standard Resolution - [1mm, 2mm, 3mm]:** The resolution (in mm) to which functional images are transformed during registration.

#. **Standard Brain only Template (functional resolution) - [path]:** Standard FSL Skull Stripped Template. Used as a reference image for functional registration.

#. **Standard Template with Skull (functional resolution) - [path]:** Standard FSL Anatomical Brain Image with skull.

#. **Standard Identity Matrix - [path]:** Matrix containing all 1's. Used as an identity matrix during registration. It is not necessary to change this path unless you intend to use non-standard MNI registration.

Configuration Using a YAML File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To configure functional to MNI registration options within a YAML file, add the following lines to your file (with appropriate substitutions for paths)::

    runRegisterFuncToMNI : [1]
    resolution_for_func : 2mm
    template_brain_only_for_anat : /usr/share/fsl/5.0/data/standard/MNI152_T1_${resolution_for_anat}_brain.nii.gz
    template_skull_for_anat : /usr/share/fsl/5.0/data/standard/MNI152_T1_${resolution_for_anat}.nii.gz
