Usage:

python main.py mode [options]

Mode is:
1	Baseline
2	LSTM-1
3	LSTM-2
4	Bi-LSTM-1

Read report.pdf in the archive for context on these models and
check the preamble of main.py for options. (Some, like --expanded_data,
don't actually do anything but decay, batch size, training epochs, etc... work)

LSTM's are especially sensitive to initialization, so results may vary run to run.
The traces in /out represent the best performance I achieved.
