Troubleshooting and Help
------------------------

C-PAC is alpha software, which means that it is still under active development and has not yet undergone large-scale testing. As such, although we have done our best to ensure a stable pipeline, there may still be a few bugs that we did not catch.
 

If you find a bug, or would like to request a new feature please visit `GitHub Issues page for CPAC <https://github.com/FCP-INDI/C-PAC/issues>`_.

If you have a question that is not answered in the User Guide, you should submit it to the `C-PAC user forum <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cpax_forum>`_.

Viewing Crash Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Crash files are generated by Nipype, and can be viewed from bash terminal by typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    nipype_display_crash crash-file.pklz


Where :file:`crash-file.pklz` is the name of the crash file you wish to view.
