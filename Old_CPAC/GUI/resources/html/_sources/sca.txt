Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA)
=====================================

Connectivity in the Brain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Brain connectivity can refer to multiple distinct concepts, and it is important to understand the differences between them. When referring to anatomy, connectivity may refer to physical connections between brain areas, such as the long-distance fiber tracts revealed through methods such as Diffusion Tensor Imaging. Another form of connectivity that is commonly discussed in the literature is "functional connectivity", which is what we will be focusing on here.

What is Functional Connectivity?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Perhaps the most confusing thing to understand about functional connectivity is that in most cases, connectivity is never actually measured. This is because the term "functional connectivity" has come to refer to similarities in patterns of brain activity between regions. Two regions are said to be functionally connected if the time series of their activity is highly correlated. The reasoning behind this definition is that brain areas with similar activity patterns are likely to be communicating and sharing information.

Seed-based Correlation Analysis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) is one of the most common ways to explore functional connectivity within the brain. Based on the time series of a seed voxel (or ROI), connectivity is calculated as the correlation of time series for all other voxels in the brain. The result of SCA is a connectivity map showing Z-scores for each voxel indicating how well its time series correlates with the time series of the seed. Below is an example connectivity map showing correlated voxels based on a seed in the precuneus.

Astute readers will note that the pattern of connectivity mapped above closely resembles the anatomy of the Default Network. Indeed, SCA may be used to explore functional networks that share similar patterns of activity.

Configuring C-PAC
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Before SCA can be calculated, you **must** first extract a seed time series from which to calculate correlations. This is done by configuring and running :doc:`Time Series Extraction </tse>`.  **You will not be able to proceed in the GUI without first entering in an ROI Specification, and will receive an error if the specification is not defined.** 

.. figure:: /_images/sca_gui_1.png

#. **Run Seed-based Correlation Analysis (SCA) - [Off, On]:**  For each extracted ROI Average and/or ROI Voxelwise time series, CPAC will generate a whole-brain correlation map. It should be noted that for a given seed/ROI, SCA maps for ROI Average and ROI Voxelwise time series will be the same.

#. **Run Multiple Regression SCA - [Off, On]:**  CPAC will enter all extracted time series from ROI Average TSE, ROI Voxelwise TSE, and Spatial Regression into a single multiple regression model and output a single correlation map.

#. **Demean Time Series - [True, False]:**  Demean each time series before running Multiple Regression SCA.

#. **Normalize Time Series - [True, False]:**  Normalize each time series before running Multiple Regression SCA.


You must also define at least one ROI mask containing the voxels you would like to correlate your seed with.  To do this perform the following steps after you have saved your YAML pipeline configuration file:

#. Create a text file named 'mask_specs.txt' (or any other reasonable name of your choosing).
#. For each line in 'mask_specs.txt', type in a full path to a binary-valued NifTI file that represents your ROI.
#. Within your pipeline configuration .yml file, set maskSpecificationFileForSCA to the full path to 'mask_specs.txt' (see 'Configuration Using a YAML File' below). 


Configuration Using a YAML File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To configure seed-based correlation analysis options within a YAML file, add the following lines to your file (with appropriate substitutions for paths)::

    maskSpecificationFileForSCA : /home/user/run/resources/mask_specs.txt
    runSCA = [0]
    runMultRegSCA : [1]
    mrsDemean : True
    mrsNorm : True
