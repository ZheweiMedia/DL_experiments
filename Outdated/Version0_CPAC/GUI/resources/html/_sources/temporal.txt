Temporal Filtering
------------------

Introduction & Background
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The overall goal of temporal filtering is to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Due to the relatively poor temporal resolution of fMRI, time series data contain little high-frequency noise. They do, however, often contain very slow frequency fluctuations that may be unrelated to the signal of interest. Slow changes in magnetic field strength may be responsible for part of the low-frequency signal observed in fMRI time series (Smith et al., 1999). Other factors contributing to noise in a time series are cardiac and respiratory effects, which will often show up as noise around ~0.15 and ~0.34 Hz, respectively (Wager et al., 2007).

Computation
^^^^^^^^^^^
The temporal filtering method implemented by C-PAC is relatively simple. Users specify a lower and upper bound for a band-pass filter, which then removes any information in frequencies outside the specified frequency band.

Applications and Recommendations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Recent work has revealed a portion of the low-frequency signal (0.01 to 0.1 Hz) to be the result of slow oscillations intrinsic to brain activity (Gee et al., 2011; Zuo et al., 2010; Schroeder and Lakatos, 2009). Utilizing measures such as Amplitude of Low Frequency Fluctuations (ALFF) and fractional ALFF, the power of these oscillations has been shown to differ both across subjects (Zang et al., 2007) and between conditions (Yan et al., 2009). Resting functional connectivity has been shown to be most prominent at these frequency bands (Cordes et al., 2001), and as such these fluctuations are commonly used to measure functional connectivity in the resting brain (Gee et al., 2010). 

As these low-frequency oscillations are likely of interest to researchers, it is important to take this knowledge into account when deciding on what temporal filtering settings to use. As a general rule, it is safe to filter frequencies below 0.0083 Hz (Ashby, 2011).

Additionally, there is some evidence (Davey et al., 2012) that temporal filtering may induce correlation in resting fMRI data, breaking the assumption of temporal sample independence and potentially invalidating the results of connectivity analysis. This should be taken into account when running temporal filtering on data on which you will later run connectivity analysis.

Configuring CPAC to run Temporal Filtering
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""
.. figure:: /_images/tf_gui.png

#. **Run Temporal Filtering - [Off, On, On/Off]:** Apply a temporal band-pass filter to functional data.

#. **Band-Pass Filters - [decimal, decimal]:** Define one or more band-pass filters by clicking the + button.

Configuration Using a YAML File
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

To configure the temporal filtering options within a YAML file, add the following lines to your file (with appropriate substitutions for paths)::

    runFrequencyFiltering : [1]
    nuisanceBandpassFreq : [[0.009, 0.1]]
